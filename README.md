# WhatsApp Chat Data and Sentiment Analyzer

# Overview
The purpose of this project is to provide detailed analytics on WhatsApp messages for a given user. It offers insights into the sentiment of the chats, analysing both mood and content. Additionally, it provides data on message frequency, timing, and types of messages sent. By understanding these patterns, users can gain a deeper perspective on their communication habits.

# Usage
The project utilizes Google APIs and requires a Google Cloud subscription for setup and analysis. Deployment of this application can be challenging due to several factors, such as the need for secure handling of personal data, compliance with WhatsApp's terms of service, and the complexity of setting up and maintaining the cloud infrastructure. As a result, this project only works locally for now, in the future I'll look into extending this functionality.
